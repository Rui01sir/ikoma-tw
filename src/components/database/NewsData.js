        content1: "Here is the translation: --- Tracking the shock absorber modification market, a domestically produced brand of shock absorbers starts at 30,000 TWD, while imported ones are priced at a minimum of 80,000 TWD. As a result, many counterfeit versions of well-known brands have emerged in the market. Some car owners, looking to save money, even purchase a set of shock absorbers online for as low as 10,000 TWD. However, the saying you get what you pay for holds true, as experts point out that the joints and top mounts of both front and rear shock absorbers, made from inferior materials, are prone to damage. On the highway, an SUV's tail continuously bounced up and down, prompting onlookers to wonder whether it was a spring car or a performance for Highway Hip-Hop. A witness (Feb 21, 2023) commented, It's shaking so much, really impressive, so much shaking! Shock absorbers are essential for stabilizing the vehicle body, and it's clear that this car’s shock absorbers are faulty. Shock absorbers are consumables, but how can car owners know when to replace them? The most obvious sign is abnormal bouncing, or if the vehicle bounces more than twice when hitting a pothole, unable to absorb the vibrations immediately. Other signs include oil leakage, and in severe cases, knocking sounds may occur. Automotive modification expert Yang Zhi-Xiong explained, Common issues include shock absorber oil leakage, and in some cases, joint breakage, particularly at the top mount, which may crack or break. There are actually many different problems that can arise. --- Let me know if any part needs to be adjusted!",
        content2:"Sure, here's the revised translation without the quotation marks: --- When it comes to shock absorbers, the shallow threading on the cylinder body can easily lead to breakage. Ideally, the base should be molded as a single piece, as welded joints are more prone to breaking. For front shock absorbers, the thickness of the top mount is also crucial; if it’s too thin, the strength will obviously be weaker. Automotive modification expert Yang Zhi-Xiong explains that the average price is around 30,000 TWD, but you can find ones on Taobao for as low as 10,000 TWD, though they might be counterfeits of big-name brands, especially the more well-known ones, which are often faked in China. The shock absorber modification market is vast, but it’s also riddled with subpar counterfeit products. A set of domestically made shock absorbers starts at 30,000 TWD, while imported ones range from 80,000 to 120,000 TWD. Chinese-made counterfeit shock absorbers can be bought for as little as 10,000 TWD. Shock absorbers are like the cerebellum of a person, stabilizing the vehicle’s body. Car owners are urged to be vigilant and not skimp on quality, as the devil is in the details, and defects may go unnoticed. --- Let me know if there's anything else you need!"
